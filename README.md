## MLOPS COMPLETE PIPELINE TUTORIAL

#### CREATE EXPERIMENTS
- Create a new experiment in the `experiments` folder.
- Then paste your initial code in the ipynb file inside the experiments folder where you will complete the Data Science pipeline from data collection to model evaluation.

#### CREATION OF SRC FOLDER
- Create a new folder named `src` in the root directory of your project. This folder will save all the components of the pipeline.
- The src folder contains all the python files that are used in the pipeline.
- Here we will have the following python files
1. data_ingestion.py
2. data_preprocessing.py
3. feature_engineering.py
4. model_training.py
5. model_evaluation.py
